# Feature Spotlight

We built the Logo Stamp tool with one goal: to make professional watermarking accessible to everyone. Here are the standout features that set us apart.

## 1. Batch Processing
Have 50 images from a photoshoot? Don't waste time editing them one by one. With our batch processing, you can upload them all and apply your watermark to the entire set in seconds.

## 2. Smart Positioning
Drag and drop your logo anywhere on the canvas. Our smart guides help you align it perfectly to corners or the center.

## 3. Transparency Control
Sometimes you need a bold watermark; other times, a subtle stamp. Our opacity slider gives you full control over visibility.

## 4. Privacy First
Your images are processed locally in your browser. We never store your photos on our servers.

Try it out now and experience the difference!
