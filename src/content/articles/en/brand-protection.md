# Protecting Your Brand Identity

Your brand is more than just a logo; it's the perception people have of your business. In an era where content is copied and pasted instantly, protecting your visual identity is paramount.

## The Risks of unsecured content

-   **Misrepresentation**: Your images could be used in contexts you don't approve of.
-   **Revenue Loss**: If you sell visual art, theft directly impacts your income.
-   **Dilution**: Low-quality re-shares can harm your brand's premium feel.

## Strategies for Protection

-   **Consistent Watermarking**: Make it a habit.
-   **High-Quality Files**: Keep your masters offline; share web-optimized versions.
-   **Monitoring**: Use tools to see where your images appear.
