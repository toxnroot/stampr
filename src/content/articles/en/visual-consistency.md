# The Power of Visual Consistency

Consistency is the secret sauce of successful branding. When your audience sees the same colors, fonts, and logo across your website, social media, and emails, they instantly recognize you.

## Building Trust

A consistent brand looks professional and reliable. If your visuals are scattered, customers might perceive your business as disorganized.

## How to Maintain Consistency

1.  **Define Your Palette**: Stick to your primary colors (like our Green #009966 and Navy #040714).
2.  **Use Templates**: Create presets for your social media posts.
3.  **Logo Placement**: Always place your logo in a similar spot (e.g., bottom right) to create a habit for the viewer.

## Tools to Help

Our Logo Stamp tool offers **Custom Positioning** and **Transparency Control**, allowing you to apply your logo exactly where it needs to be, every single time.
