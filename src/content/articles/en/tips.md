# Top 5 Tips for Effective Watermarking

Watermarking is an art. Too big, and it ruins the photo. Too small, and it's useless. Here is how to find the sweet spot.

## 1. Keep it Subtle
A watermark should be visible but not distracting. Aim for 30-50% opacity.

## 2. Placement Matters
Avoid covering the main subject (like a face or product). Corners are usually safe bets.

## 3. High Contrast
If your image is dark, use a light version of your logo. If it's bright, use a dark version.

## 4. Include Your Handles
If the goal is marketing, include your website or Instagram handle along with the logo.

## 5. Don't Overdo It
One watermark is usually enough. Tiled watermarks provide more protection but can make the image unviewable.
